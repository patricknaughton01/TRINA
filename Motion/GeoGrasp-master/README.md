# GeoGrasp
Geometry-based method for computing grasping points on 3D point clouds. Find more details at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331358070_Fast_Geometry-based_Computation_of_Grasping_Points_on_Three-dimensional_Point_Clouds

We are still working on improving the code efficiency and readability. Later, we will add tutorials on the use of GeoGrasp to work with robotic graspers.

# Requirements
The package has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. GeoGrasp is wrapped in a ROS package with the following dependecies:

- ROS Kinetic
- PCL 1.7

The rest of the dependencies (ROS packages) can be found at the `package.xml` file inside the GeoGrasp folder. In order to compile it, just clone this repository inside the `source` directory of your catkin workspace and execute `catkin_make`.

# Examples of use

At `GeoGrasp/data` we have included two PCD files with two scenes. The `creeper-isolated.pcd` holds the 3D point cloud of a toy Creeper standing on a table. In contrast, `objects-example.pcd` contains a 3D point cloud in which there are multiple objets on a table. These clouds were captured with a Intel RealSense SR300 camera. To test GeoGrasp, simply execute the test script `cloud_processor` included in the repository:

```
rosrun geograsp cloud_processor _topic:="/cloud_pcd"
```

This launches a ROS node that subscribes to the topic `/cloud_pcd` in which point clouds will be published. The node reads these point clouds and processes them in order to compute the contact points using GeoGrasp. Next, execute the following node (`pcl_ros` ROS package is required for running this example):

```
rosrun pcl_ros pcd_to_pointcloud <file.pcd>
```

This publishes the contains of the PCD file `<file.pcd>` (either of those included at `GeoGrasp/Data`) on a topic called `/cloud_pcd`. See below an example of the computed points for the example PCD files:

# TO-DOs
